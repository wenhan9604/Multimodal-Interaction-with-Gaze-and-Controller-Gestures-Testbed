This is a Final Year Project in collaboration between NTU and DSO, from Jan 2021 - Nov 2021. 

Version Control: 
  Remote Repository will contain the master version. All versions will need to be pushed to remote repo at each significant milestone. 
  Will need to maintain version control at local machine religiously. 
  Will be using Github Desktop as main tool for version control as I faced problem trying to clone repo using SSH in command line. 

Collaboration:
  I will probably be working on my laptop only. 
  To share this file, share a http request (which enables read-only).
